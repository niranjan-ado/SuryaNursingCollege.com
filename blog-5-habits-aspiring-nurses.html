                    <h3>1. Prioritize Sleep: The Ultimate Cognitive Enhancer</h3>
                    <p>In the culture of late-night study sessions, sleep is often the first sacrifice. This is a critical mistake. Sleep isn't a luxury; it's a biological necessity for memory consolidation, cognitive function, and emotional regulation. When you sleep, your brain works to transfer new information from short-term to long-term memory—a process essential for learning complex subjects like anatomy and pharmacology.</p>
                    <blockquote>"Adults aged 18-60 years should get 7 or more hours of sleep per night. Sleeping less than seven hours per day is associated with an increased risk of developing chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and frequent mental distress."<br><strong>- U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</strong></blockquote>
                    <div class="counter-section">
                        <div class="counter-grid">
                            <div class="counter-item reveal">
                                <h3 class="animated-counter" data-target="7">0</h3>
                                <p>Minimum Recommended Hours of Sleep</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Create a simple sleep ritual. Turn off screens 30 minutes before bed, try to sleep and wake around the same time each day, and ensure your room is dark and cool.</p>

                    <h3>2. Master Your Mind: The Power of Mindfulness</h3>
                    <p>The pressure of exams, clinical rotations, and a demanding curriculum can lead to significant stress. Mindfulness is the practice of being present and fully aware of the current moment, without judgment. It's a powerful tool to manage anxiety and improve focus. As taught by masters like Thich Nhat Hanh, even simple breathing exercises can anchor you in the present and calm a racing mind.</p>
                    <blockquote>"Research has shown that mindfulness practices can help reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. It can also improve attention, memory, and emotional regulation, which are critical skills for high-pressure professions like nursing."<br><strong>- American Psychological Association (APA)</strong></blockquote>
                    <p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Start small. Dedicate just five minutes each day to focus on your breath. Sit quietly, close your eyes, and simply notice the sensation of breathing in and out. When your mind wanders, gently guide it back to your breath. This simple practice builds mental resilience over time.</p>

                    <h3>3. Fuel Your Brain: Strategic Nutrition</h3>
                    <p>The food you eat directly impacts your energy levels, mood, and ability to concentrate. While convenient, a diet high in processed foods and sugar can lead to energy crashes and brain fog. Strategic nutrition is about choosing foods that provide sustained energy and support cognitive function.</p>
                    <blockquote>"A healthy diet helps to protect against malnutrition in all its forms, as well as noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), including diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer. Healthy diets include a variety of foods, with an emphasis on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats."<br><strong>- World Health Organization (WHO)</strong></blockquote>
                    <div class="counter-section">
                        <div class="counter-grid">
                            <div class="counter-item reveal">
                                <h3 class="animated-counter" data-target="5">0</h3>
                                <p>Daily Servings of Fruits & Vegetables Recommended</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Don't try to overhaul your diet overnight. Start by adding one extra fruit or vegetable to your daily meals. Ensure you drink enough water throughout the day, as dehydration is a major cause of fatigue and headaches.</p>

                    <h3>4. Move Your Body: The 150-Minute Rule</h3>
                    <p>Long hours of sitting in classrooms or the library can take a toll on your physical and mental health. Regular physical activity is proven to boost mood, improve sleep, reduce stress, and enhance cognitive function. It doesn't have to be an intense gym session; consistent, moderate activity is key.</p>
                    <blockquote>"Adults should do at least 150–300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week. Regular physical activity is crucial for preventing and helping to manage heart disease, type-2 diabetes, and cancer, as well as reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety."<br><strong>- World Health Organization (WHO)</strong></blockquote>
                    <div class="counter-section">
                        <div class="counter-grid">
                            <div class="counter-item reveal">
                                <h3 class="animated-counter" data-target="150">0</h3>
                                <p>Minutes of Moderate Exercise Per Week</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Break it down. A brisk 30-minute walk five days a week meets the goal. Take the stairs instead of the lift, walk while listening to a lecture recording, or join a campus sports group.</p>

                    <h3>5. Build Your Tribe: The Power of Connection</h3>
                    <p>The journey through nursing school can be challenging, and trying to do it alone is a recipe for burnout. Building a strong support system of friends, classmates, and mentors is one of the most important investments you can make in your well-being. These are the people who will understand your struggles, celebrate your successes, and remind you that you're not alone.</p>
                    <blockquote>"The surprising finding is that our relationships and how happy we are in our relationships has a powerful influence on our health. Close relationships, more than money or fame, are what keep people happy throughout their lives. Those ties protect people from life’s discontents, help to delay mental and physical decline, and are better predictors of long and happy lives than social class, IQ, or even genes."<br><strong>- Harvard Study of Adult Development (one of the longest-running studies on happiness)</strong></blockquote>
                    <p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Form a study group. Make an effort to talk to a new classmate each week. Seek out a faculty mentor whose experience you admire. Your "tribe" will become your greatest asset, both in college and in your future career.</p>
